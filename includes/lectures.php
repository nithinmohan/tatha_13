			Kazutaka Kurihara is a senior researcher of Media Interaction Group of Information Technology Research Institute at National Institute of Advanced Science and Technology (NIAST). He is the winner of the 2012 Ig Nobel Prize in acoustics, sponsored by the Annals of Improbable Research magazine. He and his partner, Koji Tsukada of Ochanomizu University won this award for developing the "Speech Jammer Gun", a gadget that is capable of silencingpeople from a distance of more than 30 meters. It operates on the principle of Delayed Auditory Feedback. By playing the targets' speech back to them at a delay of a few hundred milliseconds, this device painlessly "jams" their speech.  This device finds application in speaking competitions to enforce time limits.<br/>
